          From The Beginning
        </h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Allow me to reintroduce myself with a full introduction- my name is Derrick Holleman, I'm 25 years old and reside in Minneapolis, MN.  I've played guitar since 8th grade and have been a full time musician for the past 2 years.  I've really only had an interest in coding since December of 2020, but more on that later.

          <span class="accent">It all started with the video game, Guitar Hero.</span>
          Yes, what was to become my passion for the next 10 years and my full time job for 2 of those all started with a video game.  But, everyone's journey starts out differently and mine was brought on by what is some parents worst nightmare - a child who plays video games from morning to night and barely goes outside.  My obsession with Guitar Hero soon led to me getting my first guitar from a cousin of mine.  A year after I got my first guitar I joined my high school's jazz band and played on stage for the first time.  I was a pretty shy kid, so I thought playing on stage would not be for me, but instead playing guitar for people turned out to be the only time I actually liked being the center of attention.

          McNally Smith College of Music
        </h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Fortunately, I was able to follow my passion and go to college for music where I would meet a lot of connections to get me more confident and focused on my path into the music world.  Unfortunately, my passion was a liberal art and as a lot of people who went to college for a liberal art can relate to, probably not the best decision in hindsight.  But at the time, I couldn't imagine going to college for anything else.  Like most things in life though, my college experience didn't turn out as planned. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="main-text">
          <span class="accent">My college suddenly closed before I graduated.</span>
          To be exact, it closed one semester before I was supposed to graduate in the spring.  We first got notice of the closure during <i>finals week</i> of the winter semester.  Everyone already had their classes for spring planned out with counselors, seniors ready to graduate, the college even continued to send out acceptance letters.  The college leadership was simply hiding the fact it was running out of money until the last cent, which is when they couldn't hide it anymore.  Everyone had to be out of the dorms in one weeks time.  This includes students who attended the college from different states and countries.  It was a whole mess that you can read about more <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/19/571997969/minnesota-music-college-closes-abruptly-and-students-scramble-to-find-schools" target="_blank">here</a> if you are interested.  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="main-text last-paragraph">
          I was one of the lucky ones who lived in the state of Minnesota where the college was located, so my scramble to find a new school before spring semester was definitely hectic, but not as detrimental to my education timeline as it could've been.  I ended up settling on a school named Augsburg University which was located about 15 minutes away from McNally Smith.  McNally Smith focused more on contemporary music, whereas Augsburg specialized in classical music so the change was not easy to get used to.  I ended up doing the absolute miniumum in order to graduate just so I could be done with my music degree.  The transfer to Augsburg added 1 and a half years onto my education, so I was tired of school to say the least.  But, with degree in hand 5 and a half years after I was accepted into college, I set off to make my mark on the music world.

          My Friend Oatmeal?
        </h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Yes, My Friend Oatmeal.  It's the name of my solo music project, where I write and record all the songs by myself.  Nobody knows what the name means when they first hear it, but to me this name has a personal meaning.  I'm not going to get into the meaning here because I don't really focus on that music project anymore, but my My Friend Oatmeal project was about 2 years of writing music that I was very proud of.  It didn't catch a lot of traction outside of my friend group as is the story for most local musicians, but I got enjoyment out of creating something that I thought sounded good.  If you want to be the judge of that as well, you can check out the music on 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdVL7KUnYjvHXFG9wZYNnrg" target="_blank">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5iWsYiO66RyOUgE0zv0SBm" target="_blank">Spotify</a>!

        <br/>
        <p class="main-text last-paragraph">
          <span class="accent">Nowadays I mainly play in cover bands and at church on Sundays.</span>  The cover band market is very solid here in Minneapolis, assuming you don't mind playing the same songs over and over again.  If you get lucky enough to meet and then earn your reputation amongst a well-connected circle of musicians, you can have steady gigs year round.  I've enjoyed a fair amount of success in the music industry here ever since about late 2019.  After I met NBC's the Voice finalist, Ashley Dubose, and then played guitar for her at a <a href="https://www.sofarsounds.com/" target="_blank">Sofar Sounds</a> gig, I steadily grew my circle of connections to the point where I could make music my full time job.  But, continuing with the theme from my college experience, things rarely go as planned.  Just as I was getting going in the Minneapolis music scene and starting to get comfortable with my new full time job that I'd carved out from nothing, the worst case scenario that nobody saw coming happened...

          My experience during the COVID-19 pandemic
        </h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Yeah, that happened.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="main-text">
          <span class="accent">All of my gigs were gone almost overnight.</span> I remember reading some news stories about COVID in Wuhan, China and then how it was spreading through the rest of China, but had assumed it was going to be another one of those foreign diseases that stays a foreign disease.  I was at a recording session one night and I vividly recall one of the musicians talking about how sports games were needing to be cancelled because of the players catching COVID and I think that was the first time I felt like the spreading of the virus could actually start to affect me and my livelihood.  Not too long after that, a popular weekly open mic I was part of was cancelled.  Then gigs one month out were being cancelled and then two months out and suddenly my whole summer calendar was empty.  It just kept going on with that theme for pretty much the whole year of 2020 and into 2021.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="main-text">
            Seeing how quickly my music calendar cleared out and then how long it was taking for things to go back to normal made me realize that music was a very fragile way of living.  I had realized this before because even in normal circumstances gigs are not always guaranteed, but in emergency situations, entertainment is the first thing to go.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="main-text">
            <span class="accent">I spent the last half of 2020 basically doing nothing.</span> Nothing except for playing video games and watching video games on Twitch.tv.  This half a year centered around video games unexpectedly led me to my interest in coding.  Specifically what led me to my interest is a streamer named Giant Waffle.  He is a video game streamer on Twitch who, like me, has an interest in Science and Technology. He often talks about these topics with his chat on stream while playing video games.  One day he mentioned how one of his cousins picked up a coding book without a prior interest in coding and in about 6 months his cousin landed a job in the early days of Tumblr.  I had never really thought about anything coding related before this point, never understood how any of it worked.  But, the way he was talking about it, made it seem easy.  I know now that coding is definitely not easy!  It's only for you if you have the motivation to learn a lot in a short time, but I'm glad I was under the impression coding was easy when I first started or I probably wouldn't have started at all.  And so, a worst case scenario opened a new door, to new opportunities and then maybe to a new life where I don't have to rely on the unstable world of music or a minumum wage job to make a living.
